2. **Adding Products to Cart:**
   - Click the "Add to Cart" button below the desired product.
   - The selected product will be added to the cart section displayed on the right side of the page.

3. **Removing Products from Cart:**
   - In the cart section, each item has a "Remove" button.
   - Click the "Remove" button associated with an item to remove it from the cart.

4. **Responsiveness:**
   - The webpage is responsive and adjusts its layout for optimal viewing on different devices.
